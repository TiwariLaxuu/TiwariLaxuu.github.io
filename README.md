## Summary
As a graduate student, I am a committed and dedicated professional with a strong work ethic and a passion for excellence. I bring 3+ years of hands-on experience in machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning implementation across various domains such as games, trading, and ridesharing. This journey has not only honed my technical skills but has also involved extensive research, particularly in mathematics and algorithms.

## Work Experience

### AI Engineer - Logictronix Technologies (Jan 2022)
- Reviewed and researched different GitHub papers to identify research gaps and algorithms.
- Developed a model for risk minimization and profit optimization in High-Frequency Trading.
